# Span-Detection-
Detecting spam alerts in emails and messages is one of the main applications that every big tech company tries to improve for its customers. Whenever you submit details about your email or contact number on any platform, it has become easy for those platforms to market their products by advertising them by sending emails or by sending messages directly to your contact number. This results in lots of spam alerts and notifications in your inbox. This is where the task of spam detection comes in.
